# GithubHacks
My attempts to make GitHub work better for me.

I want to be able to
1. Check if I've contributed something to GitHub today, and if so, do nothing further;
2. If I haven't, I want to either send myself a reminder, or upload a file to GitHub

So far I have a script that can get on my GitHub and check, accurately, whether I've contributed something today. What it CAN'T do is either option for #2 (which is fairly easy to implement, at least the first option), or check continuously every day (because I can't figure out how to get a Daemon, or whatever the Windows equivalent is, to run on Windows. All the resources are only for Linux/Unix. Which totally makes sense, because only like 91.76% of all computer users use Windows).
